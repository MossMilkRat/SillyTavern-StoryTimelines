## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SillyTavern-StoryTimelines.git
cd SillyTavern-StoryTimelines
```

2. Create a symlink to your SillyTavern extensions folder for testing:

## Coding Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names

### JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// Good
function formatStoryTime(storyTime) {
    const date = new Date(storyTime);
    return date.toLocaleDateString();
}

// Bad
function fst(st) {
    var d = new Date(st);
    return d.toLocaleDateString();
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

```css
/* Good */
.storytimeline-message {
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    padding: 12px;
    background: var(--black30a);
}

/* Bad */
.storytimeline-message{margin-bottom:15px;padding:12px;background:var(--black30a);}
```

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add drag-and-drop reordering functionality

- Implement drag handlers for timeline messages
- Add visual feedback during drag operation
- Update story times on drop
- Fixes #123
```
