## Usage

### Opening the Timeline

- **Via Extensions Menu**: Click the clock icon in the extensions menu
- **Via Slash Command**: Type `/loretimeline` in the chat input
- **Via Fallback Menu**: Click the clock icon in the top settings bar (if slash commands unavailable)

### Tagging Lorebook Entries

1. Open the Lorebook Timeline panel
2. Select a lorebook from the dropdown
3. Click **"Tag Untagged Entries"** to tag the first untagged entry
4. Or click the **pencil icon** next to any entry in the timeline to edit its story time
5. Set the story date and optionally time (or check "Date Only" for events without specific times)
6. Click **"Save Tag"**

### Viewing Different Time Scales

Use the view dropdown to switch between:
- **All Time**: See all events in one list
- **By Year**: Events grouped by year
- **By Month**: Events grouped by month
- **By Week**: Events grouped by week
- **By Day**: Events grouped by day
- **By Hour**: Events grouped by hour

This is especially useful for long timelines spanning centuries or for detailed hour-by-hour event sequences.

### Reordering Events

With drag & drop enabled (default):
1. Open the Lorebook Timeline panel
2. Click and drag any entry
3. Drop it on another entry to swap their story times
4. Changes are saved automatically

### Exporting Timeline

Click the **Export Timeline** button to generate a markdown file containing:
- All tagged entries in chronological order
- Formatted with dates, keywords, and content
- Perfect for reference or sharing with others

### Settings

Access settings by clicking the gear icon in the Timeline panel or using `/loretimeline`:

- **Show Timeline Icon**: Toggle visibility of the timeline button in extensions menu
- **Enable Drag & Drop**: Allow/prevent reordering entries via drag & drop
- **Auto Refresh**: Automatically update timeline when switching lorebooks
- **Date/Time Format**: Choose between 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour time format

## Data Structure

The extension adds a custom field to lorebook entries:

```javascript
{
  "uid": 1703001234567,
  "key": ["Kingdom of Mossford", "Mossford"],
  "comment": "Founding of Mossford",
  "content": "The Kingdom of Mossford was founded...",
  "extensions": {
    "storytimelines": {
      "storyTime": "1247-03-15T14:00:00.000Z",
      "dateOnly": false
    }
  }
}
```

This data is saved directly to your lorebook JSON files and persists between sessions.

## Example Timeline

Here's how you might organize a fantasy world's history:

```
Year 1247
  ‚îú‚îÄ March 15: Founding of Mossford Kingdom
  ‚îî‚îÄ August 3: First Dragon Sighting

Year 1248
  ‚îú‚îÄ January 12: The Great Winter begins
  ‚îî‚îÄ December 25: Discovery of Ancient Ruins

Year 1250
  ‚îî‚îÄ June 7: War of the Three Kingdoms starts
```
